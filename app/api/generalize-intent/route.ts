Rules — VERY IMPORTANT:
- Strip out SPECIFIC values: amounts, currencies, dates, proper names, places, counts of people.
- Replace them with general descriptors: "friends", "a group", "a topic", "an amount", "a target audience".
- Keep the original structure, intent, and language style (English stays English).
- Output ONLY the rewritten template — no preamble, no quotes, no commentary, no markdown.

Examples:
Input: "Split a mamak bill of RM 87 among 4 friends (Ali, Ahmad, Siti, Jia) and shame those who don't pay"
Output: Split a mamak bill among friends and shame those who don't pay

Input: "Translate my README from English to Mandarin for my Chinese boss"
Output: Translate text from one language to another for a target audience

Input: "Research the top 5 NFT projects launched in 2024 and write a 300-word summary"
Output: Research top NFT projects and write a short summary

Input: "Build a smart contract that splits a mamak bill of RM 87 among 4 friends and shame those who don't pay"
Output: Build a smart contract that splits a bill among friends and shame those who don't pay

Input: "Find the best mamak in PJ"
Output: Find the best mamak in a chosen area`
